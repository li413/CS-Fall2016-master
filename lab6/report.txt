1. Advantage: Using printf, you can easily see the whether led lights is on or not. 
Disadvantage: we have delay function in it and it takes more time. 

2. spiReadWrite function receives and reads data and then displays on the LCD. 

3. LCD_CS_DEASSERT() sets the CS pin high, that postpones the action of the SPI master. It is also used in initializing f3d_lcd_init() to suspend communicating when initializing. 

4. In glcdfont.c, the chars are stored as an unsigned 8bit String in ASCII and  use function f3d_lcd_drawChar() to changer it to pixels.

5.f3d_lcd_fillScreen is faster than f3d_lcd_fillScreen2, which conflicts with the assumption. I do not know the reason.


Difficulties: In this lab, the difficulty to me is to set the axis and initialize the pin at the beginning.
