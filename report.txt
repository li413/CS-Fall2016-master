1. STM32 which is ARM Cortex-M4

2. GPIO stands for general-purpose that is used to read values from or write values to pins on the chip boundaries 

3. The delay function is accurate even if there is no parameter. The delay function controls the speed of led flash.

4. Port E Pin 11 and  Port E Pin 15

5. GPIO_Pin, GPIO_OType,GPIO_Mode,GPIO_Speed,GPIO_Pupd


The difficulties for me in this lab is to control the button. Write a function that when I push the button, the light on. At the beginning I have no idea about the function in the led.c. I know I should use the if statement but I have to learn how to intialize the GPIO structure and the GPIO functions.
