1.  CS pin is used to signal to the slave when we start and end to transfer data.

2. Because read/write functions to the gyro will assume that this pin is high after initialization. 

f3d_gyro_read, f3d_gyro_write are set low to high.

3. we should connect necessary wires correctly.

4.Baud rate is 8 and frequency is 9.

5.Yes slave need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the master. It can satisfy  different communication requirements.

What learnt: in this lab I do learnt how to use gdb to debug a function. We can set a break point in the function and see the output in each steps.
The difficulty: in this lab is step 8. We have trouble seeting the axis. It is really challenge to make the lights on when we rotate the board.
