1.    2 connections 1 send 1receive.

2.    It work on several functions at the same time and pin is used for input and output

3.    Baud rate is the rate that information can be tansferred in a communication channel.

4.    Newlib_stubs is a c language library so we really need it so we can use some functions.
      printf() function is buildin function in the library, so if we do not have newlib_stubs,
      we cannot use printf().

5.    I can get a graph as feedback when there are some bugs or pauses. It is easier to see the
      situations

In this lab, I learned how to write getchar() and putchar() functions. And I can use serialT to 
communicate with the board.

The difficulity my partner and I encoutered is we don't know how to write the while loop in the main.c,
so that we can count the words we typed.
