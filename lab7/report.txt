Q1:


There are 14 pins totally:

Vdd_IO, SCL, SDA, INT2, INT1, C1, GND, Reserved, DRDY, Reserved, Reserved, SETP, SETC, and Vdd

accelerometer/magnetometer requires 2.16 Volts. It is a small black rectangle chip located near the top right.


Question 2: 


We write to the accelerometer/magnetometer to set up the settings which determines how we receive data. 

In the f3d_accel.c file: 
normal power mode, all axis enable, 
continuous update, little endian, 2G Sensitivity, high resolution mode, 
HPF cutoff 16, high pass filter normal mode, AO1/AO1 disabled.

In the f3d_mag.c file:
temp sensor disabled, 30Hz output rate, 
+/- 8.1 gauss full scale, continuous conversion


Question 3:


Those lines takes the raw data out of the buffer, sets it in a raw_data array. 
Then puts it in a accel_data array after divided by 1000 so we can use it.


Question 4:


It might be necessary to have tilt compensatation with your compass because if the compass is not flat, 
it will give the wrong direction.

Dificulties:
            In this lab, the difficulities to my partner and me are getting the Tilt Angle Visualization
            and Compass visualization.
            We use the led light to set the compass visualizations and it is difficult to set the direction.
            In the tilt angle visualization we did our work but it is difficult to set two bars to show the 
            pitch and roll

Learned:
            In this lab, I also learned how to initialize the pins. I also learned how to set the range to make the campass.
