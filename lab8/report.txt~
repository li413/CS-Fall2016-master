* Learn: What data does nunchuck returned; how to use these data and put them visualization.

* Difficulties: It is hard to switch between visualization without the screen effect on each other. 

*Questions:
Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?

Because nunchuk is controlled through IC2.  


Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?



Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk? Hint: It may be best to answer this question after the checkpoint
jx - joystick x axis
jy - joystick y axis
ax - accelerometer x 
ay - accelerometer y 
az - accelerometer z 
c - c button
z - z button


Q4) Explain the code above
